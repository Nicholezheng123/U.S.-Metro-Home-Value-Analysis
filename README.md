# U.S.-Metro-Home-Value-Analysis
This repository is made for ILRST 2130 project.

Housing markets in the United States vary widely across metropolitan areas, with median home values differing widely between regions. These differences come from local economic conditions, labor markets and demographic factors.  Recent data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis showed that the median sales price of houses sold in the United States has increased by approximately 30 percent in recent years, highlighting the importance of understanding the factors associated with rising housing values across regions.

In this project, we seek to determine which economic and demographic factors are most influential in explaining variation in median home values across U.S. metropolitan areas. Using metropolitan-level data from the American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates, we model median home value as a function of income, education, unemployment, population density, age composition, and housing tenure.

This project is written for real estate and housing market analysts interested in understanding cross-metropolitan variation in housing prices. Analysts frequently examine how economic conditions, labor markets, and population characteristics relate to housing demand and prices across regions. By using publicly available Census data, this analysis hopes to explore which metropolitan-level factors are most strongly associated with median home values, providing insight into patterns across U.S. housing markets.
